# 1. Remove Snabbdom Dependency

Date: 2024-12-24

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The project currently uses Snabbdom as a virtual DOM implementation, which brings in over 600 transitive dependencies. This significantly increases the project's complexity and maintenance burden.

## Decision
Remove Snabbdom and its dependent code to reduce the dependency footprint of the project.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Significantly reduced dependency count
- Simpler maintenance
- Smaller package size

### Negative
- Need to remove or rewrite code that depends on Snabbdom
- May need to implement alternative DOM manipulation strategy if required

## Implementation Plan
1. Identify all Snabbdom-dependent code
2. Remove Snabbdom from package.json
3. Remove or rewrite affected code
4. Update tests
5. Verify core functionality remains intact
