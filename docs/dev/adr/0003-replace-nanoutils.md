# 3. Replace Nanoutils with Custom Functions

Date: 2024-12-24

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The project uses nanoutils for utility functions, which brings in unnecessary code bloat. Modern JavaScript/TypeScript provides many of these capabilities natively, and simple utility functions can be implemented directly.

## Decision
Replace all nanoutils functions with custom implementations to:
1. Reduce dependency footprint
2. Maintain full control over utility functions
3. Potentially improve performance with specialized implementations

## Consequences
### Positive
- Reduced package size
- No external dependencies for basic utilities
- Better understanding of utility code
- Potential performance improvements

### Negative
- Need to maintain our own utility functions
- Need to ensure proper testing of utility functions

## Implementation Plan
1. Identify all nanoutils usage
2. Create custom implementations
3. Replace imports
4. Add tests for new utility functions
