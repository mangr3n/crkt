# 8. Integrate ReScript

Date: 2024-12-24

## Status
Proposed

## Context
As we modernize our codebase, we're looking to leverage a strongly-typed functional programming language that can seamlessly integrate with our JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem. ReScript offers several compelling advantages:
- Zero-runtime overhead
- Excellent JavaScript interop
- Strong type system with sound null checking
- Fast compilation
- Small bundle size
- Pattern matching and other functional programming features

## Decision
Integrate ReScript into our project to:
1. Improve code reliability through its sound type system
2. Enhance performance with zero-cost abstractions
3. Leverage functional programming patterns
4. Maintain easy JavaScript interoperability
5. Reduce runtime errors through compile-time checks

## Consequences
### Positive
- Better type safety than TypeScript
- Improved performance through optimized compilation
- Reduced runtime errors
- Access to powerful functional programming features
- Smaller bundle sizes
- Fast development feedback loop due to quick compilation

### Negative
- Learning curve for team members new to ReScript
- Need to maintain interop boundaries with existing JavaScript/TypeScript code
- Additional build configuration required
- May need to recreate some existing utilities in ReScript
- Limited ecosystem compared to TypeScript

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up ReScript build tools and configuration
2. Create initial ReScript integration points
3. Define JavaScript/ReScript interop boundaries
4. Start with new features in ReScript
5. Gradually migrate existing components
6. Update build pipeline to handle ReScript
7. Create coding guidelines for ReScript
8. Document patterns for JavaScript/ReScript interop
9. Set up testing infrastructure for ReScript code
10. Train team on ReScript best practices
