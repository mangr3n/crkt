# 1. Core Architecture

Date: 2024-12-20 0802 EST

## Status
Proposed

## Context
CRKT is a reimplementation of graflow with production-tested enhancements from HYL. We need to define the core architecture that maintains graflow's simplicity while supporting advanced features.

## Decision
1. Maintain core component system similar to graflow
   - Keep zero-dependency philosophy
   - Preserve graph-based flow definition
   - Support cyclic flows

2. Add plugin system for platform-specific code
   - Browser integration components
   - Platform-specific optimizations
   - Development tools

3. Enhance component composition
   - Improved type system
   - Better error handling
   - Enhanced debugging capabilities

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance
- Better extensibility
- Improved developer experience

### Negative
- Initial complexity in plugin system
- Potential performance overhead
- Migration effort for existing users

## Notes
This architecture allows us to maintain graflow's simplicity while adding production-ready features from HYL.
