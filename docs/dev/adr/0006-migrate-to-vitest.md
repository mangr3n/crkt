# 6. Migrate to Vitest

Date: 2024-12-24

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The project needs a modern, fast, and feature-rich testing solution that aligns with our TypeScript-based architecture. Vitest offers several advantages as a testing framework:
- Native TypeScript support
- Compatible with Vite's configuration
- Significantly faster test execution through parallel running
- Better developer experience with watch mode and UI
- ESM-first approach

## Decision
Migrate the project's test suite to Vitest to:
1. Improve test execution speed
2. Better integrate with our modern TypeScript toolchain
3. Take advantage of Vitest's advanced features
4. Prepare for future Vite integration

## Consequences
### Positive
- Faster test execution
- Better developer experience
- Native TypeScript support
- Modern ESM-first approach
- Improved test watching capabilities
- Potential for test UI integration

### Negative
- Need to migrate existing tests
- Team needs to learn Vitest's specific features
- Potential differences in test behavior requiring adjustments

## Implementation Plan
1. Add Vitest as a development dependency
2. Create Vitest configuration
3. Migrate existing tests incrementally
4. Update CI/CD pipeline for Vitest
5. Document new testing patterns and best practices
6. Remove old test runner and related dependencies
