# 2. Modernize TypeScript Toolchain

Date: 2024-12-24

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The project currently uses an older TypeScript version (3.3.1) with Babel for transpilation. Modern TypeScript (5.x+):
- Has native ESM support
- Improved performance
- Better type inference
- Built-in transpilation capabilities
- Native decorator support

## Decision
Update to latest TypeScript and remove Babel dependencies since:
1. TypeScript's built-in compiler (tsc) can handle all our transpilation needs
2. Modern Node.js has native ESM support
3. We don't need Babel's polyfills for modern JavaScript environments
4. Simplified build pipeline will reduce complexity

## Consequences
### Positive
- Simpler build process
- Fewer dependencies
- Better TypeScript features
- Improved performance
- Cleaner development experience

### Negative
- May need to update some TypeScript syntax
- Might need to adjust tsconfig.json for modern settings

## Implementation Plan
1. Review current tsconfig.json settings
2. Remove Babel dependencies
3. Update TypeScript to latest version
4. Update build scripts
5. Test compilation and runtime behavior
