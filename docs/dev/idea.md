## Core Concepts
- Flow-based programming using directed graphs
- Components as primary building blocks
- First-class support for cyclic flows
- Browser and platform agnostic core
- Extensible component system

## Key Objectives
1. Maintain graflow's simplicity and zero-dependency philosophy
2. Incorporate battle-tested browser interfacing from HYL
3. Improve component composition and reusability
4. Enhance developer experience with better tooling and debugging

## Technical Focus
- Core flow engine
- Standard component library
- Browser integration components
- Development tools and debugging utilities
